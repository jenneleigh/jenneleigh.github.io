					<h1>Hi! I'm Jenné</h1>
					<h2>and I think design systems are pretty neat!</h2>
					<p>
						While I have a background as a design generalist (print, web, social, code, you name it), these days I'm all about design systems. I love building beautiful Figma components, obsessing over the minutest of usage edge
						cases, writing helpful documentation and making sure everything I build is accessible.
					</p>
					<p>When I'm not heads down in Figma, you can find me chillaxing in my favorite SF coffee shops, making ceramics at my neighborhood studio or taking too many pictures of my cat.</p>
					<p>Keep scrolling for some selected highlights of my work. Wanna know even more about me and my work? <a href="mailto:jenne@jenneleigh.com?subject=Hello" title="Get in touch">Get in touch!</a></p>

					<h2>Phi</h2>
					<h3>Sigma's design system</h3>
					<p>The majority of my time at Sigma was spent designing, maintaining and educating about our design system, which we dubbed Phi.</p>
					<p>
						Phi has all of the standard design system qualities: cohesion, flexibility, scalability, accessibility, etc. Uniquely, Phi was built to be fully user-themeable, as many of Sigma's customers embedded our product
						within their own product environments.

						<h2>UployBot</h2>
						<h3>Giving our internal tools a much needed facelift</h3>
						<p>Poor little Uploybot. Originally just a tool to help release code to production, over the years it slowly gained more and more features, without ever getting even a once-over from a designer.</p>
						<p>
							My engineering team finally got fed up with the state of Uploybot and tapped me to help design a top-to-bottom rebuild of the tool using Phi. To say the redesign was a success would be an understatement.
							Engineers company-wide loved the visual upgrade and the streamlined flows. The update also served as a good test example of how easy it was to migrate code to Phi.

						<h2>Project: Perspective</h2>
						<h3>What if&hellip;we could make Workbook theming painless?</h3>
						<p>
							When our new VP of Design started, he kicked off a skunkworks project to redesign the look and feel of our Workbooks UI, codenamed Horizon. He then tasked me, as the resident color expert, to take on imaging a
							new interface for Workbooks theming, codenamed Perspective (get it?).
						</p>
						<p>
							The goal of the project was to streamline the theming process and lessen the analysis paralysis our less design-savvy users felt when presented with our broad suite of theming options. You can play with the
							prototype I built below and see if you agree.

						<p>For Sigma's 2024 Summer Hackathon, I did a silly little lightning talk presentation about "juice", the art of bringing a little extra oomph to your interactive designs.</p>
						<p class="small">(This was also right after Sigma launched their most recent rebrand, so I took the opportunity to really show off how fun the new brand was to all our engineers.)</p>

						<h2>Figma Template</h2>
						<h3>Design ops, my beloved</h3>
						<p>
							The design team's file hygiene was notoriously poor and it made it difficult to onboard new designers and ensure engineers wrote clean code. To help us start new projects off on the right foot, I set up a new
							Figma template with sample layouts and a commonly used components sticker sheet.
